## Version 2.1.0 (2025-08-03)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `smart_crawl` bug where markdown object was incorrectly printed as `[object Object]`
  - Now correctly accesses `result.markdown.raw_markdown` for content display
- Fixed integration test timeout issues:
  - Replaced example.com with httpbin.org/html in tests to avoid "domcontentloaded" timeout issues
  - Fixed httpbin.org URLs by adding proper path suffixes (e.g., /links/5/0)
  - Limited Jest parallelization for integration tests to prevent server overload
- Fixed parameter mapping in `get_markdown` tool - now correctly maps schema properties (`filter`, `query`, `cache`) to API parameters (`f`, `q`, `c`)
- Fixed `smart_crawl` schema to use `follow_links` parameter instead of `remove_images`
- Fixed `extract_links` schema mismatch - corrected schema to use `categorize` parameter as defined in tool
- Fixed `extract_links` implementation to properly handle link objects returned by API
- Fixed `crawl_recursive` schema mismatch - corrected schema to use `include_pattern` and `exclude_pattern` instead of `filter_pattern` and `bypass_cache`
- Fixed `crawl_recursive` implementation to use `/crawl` endpoint instead of `/md` for proper link extraction
- Fixed `crawl_recursive` type issues and improved link handling for recursive crawling
- Fixed `parse_sitemap` implementation to fetch sitemaps directly instead of through Crawl4AI server API
- Fixed `create_session` schema to make `session_id` optional as documented
- Enhanced `create_session` response to include all session parameters for programmatic access
- Implemented proper handling for non-functional server parameters:
  - `batch_crawl`: `remove_images` now uses `exclude_tags` in crawler_config to actually remove images
  - `smart_crawl`: `follow_links` now crawls URLs found in sitemaps/RSS feeds (max 10 URLs)
- Fixed `crawl` and `generate_pdf` tools PDF response to use proper MCP SDK embedded resource format with blob field

### Improvements
